# Magic 8 Ball

## My Goal

To apply the skills I learned in the Dicee tutorial and make an app with functionality all by myself. No new concepts here. But flyin’ solo this time! It’s when you’re using your new-found programming skills to bend the app to your will that you’re truly levelling up as a developer!

## What I'll create

I'm going to make a Magic 8 Ball app. You can ask the app to make all your hard decisions! With this app in your pocket, you’ll always have an answer to life’s many conundrums!
