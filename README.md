# Magic 8 Ball

## Challenges I Faced?

I want to comprehend how to make app with functionality. It's one thing to simply follow a tutorial but it's a whole other thing to be able to take the tools that I learned and use them independently with my own creativity.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

Before I wrote a line of code I wrote out what I wanted to happen step-by-step on a whiteboard. Once I had a general idea of how the program should work I began to take the logic that I wrote out in common english and translated into Swift bit by bit. By leveraging platforms like Google, YouTube, MDN docs, Stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides I was able to find the proper Swift methods and functions needed to complete the task and I programmed the 8 Ball accordingly.

## What Did I Learn? 

* The basics of developing in xcode
* Manipulate images using the view controller
* How to work with arrays in swift
* The basics of the UIKit
